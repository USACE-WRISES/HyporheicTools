Third-Party Notices and License Information
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scope
- The MIT license above applies to the original source code in this repository
  (e.g., files under `src/HyporheicTools/**`, project configuration, and
  documentation), except where noted below.
- Some components included with this repository are third-party works that are
  provided under their own licenses. Those licenses govern your use of those
  components and are not superseded by the MIT license above.

Bundled Binaries (bin/modflow, src/HyporheicTools/bin/modflow)
- This repository includes certain groundwater modeling executables for
  convenience, such as (names may vary by platform/version):
  `mf6.exe`, `libmf6.dll`, `mp7.exe`, `zbud6.exe`, `zonbud3.exe`, `mf2000.exe`,
  `mf2005.exe`, `mfusg.exe`, `mfnwt.exe`, `mflgr.exe`, `mt3dms.exe`,
  `mt3dusgs.exe`, `vs2dt.exe`, `crt.exe`, and related tools. These are
  authored primarily by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and are generally
  released by USGS as public domain works. They are redistributed here for
  user convenience and are provided AS IS without warranty. When redistributing
  these binaries, retain USGS attribution and disclaimers and do not imply
  USGS endorsement of your product.
- Trade, firm, or product names are used for descriptive purposes only and do
  not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.

Triangle (triangle.exe)
- The `triangle.exe` binary is distributed under a custom license authored by
  Jonathan Richard Shewchuk. It has specific redistribution and usage terms
  that may restrict certain uses. If you redistribute this binary, include the
  Triangle license text and ensure your use complies with the author’s terms.
  If your intended use is commercial or otherwise restricted, obtain the
  appropriate permission or remove this binary from your distribution.

Python Dependencies (installed via pip/conda; not bundled here)
- This project depends on several third-party Python packages that are not
  included in this repository’s source code or wheels. They are installed
  separately in your environment and are governed by their own licenses. Common
  examples include: NumPy (BSD-3-Clause), SciPy (BSD-3-Clause), pandas
  (BSD-3-Clause), Matplotlib (Matplotlib License), Seaborn (BSD-3-Clause),
  Shapely (BSD-3-Clause; links to GEOS), Rasterio (BSD-3-Clause), GeoPandas
  (BSD-3-Clause), PyProj (MIT), FloPy (BSD-3-Clause), and others. Always refer
  to each package’s distribution metadata for the authoritative license.
- Note on GEOS/LGPL: Shapely dynamically links to GEOS (LGPL). This repository
  does not bundle GEOS. If you create a frozen/standalone binary that bundles
  GEOS, ensure your distribution complies with the LGPL’s requirements.

How to Produce a Complete Third-Party Report for Your Build
- For transparency when packaging or releasing, generate a third-party license
  report from your active environment, then archive it with your release:
  Example: `pip install pip-licenses && pip-licenses --from=mixed \
  --with-urls --with-license-file --format=markdown > THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`
  Review and append notices for any bundled non-Python binaries (e.g., USGS,
  Triangle) so the report reflects what you actually redistribute.

Contact and Attribution
- Please keep this file with any copies or distributions of the repository.
- For questions about HyporheicTools licensing, open an issue in the project
  repository. For third-party components, consult the original authors.
